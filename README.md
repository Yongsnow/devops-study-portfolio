## 📚 About

This portfolio includes:

- 🌐 Core concepts of **DevOps** (CI/CD, IaC, Monitoring, etc.)
- 🛠️ Hands-on work with **Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible**, and more
- 🧪 Real-world projects and end-to-end automation pipelines
- 📑 Notes, tutorials, and technical references

## ✨ Highlights

✅ Step-by-step labs for **Docker** and **Kubernetes**  
🔄 End-to-end **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions & Jenkins  
📦 Infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform**  
🔐 Secrets management and **DevSecOps** integration  
☁️ **Cloud env/local-env automation** for deployment and scaling

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **strong foundation** in DevOps principles through both **local (Vagrant-based)** and **cloud (AWS-based)** environments  
- Learn how to **design, automate, and stabilize CI/CD architectures** for scalable deployments  
- Practice creating **fully automated test and deployment pipelines**, from Vagrant CI/CD labs to cloud-native implementations  
- Document hands-on experiments in a **clear, reproducible format** for continuous improvement  
- Prepare for **real-world DevOps Engineer interviews** and build a practical project portfolio  
- Work toward certifications such as:
  - 🧾 **AWS Developer / DevOps Engineer Professional**
  - ☸️ **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)**

## 📖 Reference & Credits

This portfolio is based on my learning and practice from the **“Master Your DevOps Skills with Real Challenge”** course  
by **Instructor: Imran Teli** on Udemy.

All materials in this repository are **self-practiced and restructured** based on my understanding of the course.  
Folders or files labeled **`lecture`** represent implementations where the same DevOps tools and environment setup  
from the course were **replicated and customized** for personal study and experimentation.
