## 📖 Reference & Credits

This portfolio is based on my learning and practice from the **“Master Your DevOps Skills with Real Challenge”** course  
by **Instructor: Imran Teli** on Udemy.

All materials in this repository are **self-practiced and restructured** based on my understanding of the course.  
Folders or files labeled **`lecture`** represent implementations where the same DevOps tools and environment setup  
from the course were **replicated and customized** for personal study and experimentation.
